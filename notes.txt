Notes on AVR Assembly Setup

Setting Up Avra Assembler
=========================

Download the source code for avra from Github: 
	
	git@github.com:Ro5bert/avra.git

To build avra from scratch:


	# cd into the root directory and run:
	make


Check Programmer Connection
===========================

To check the device/programmer are working, run the command
below (adjust for your programmer and chip):

	avrdude -c usbasp -p m168

-c	programmer type
-p	AVR part/device

If you call avrdude -c without the part, it will give you 
a list of available AVR device strings to choose from.

Note, my chips that look like m168p read as m168. Shrug?

Check Fuse Settings
===================

You can check the fuse settings like:

	avrdude -c usbasp -v -p m168

I noticed that it won't output information about the fuses if 
it thinks that the chip is wrong, however.

Building
========

To build using avra is trivial:

	avra filename.asm

Flashing the Chip
=================

	avrdude -c usbasp -p m168 -U flash:w:hello.hex
	
You may also want to set the bitrate:

	 -b 57600

Obviously, change these settings however it makes sense for your
particular setup.

A Note on Power
===============

I noticed that the AVR chips can be a bit sensitive about VCC
while being programmed, and that power via USB / programmer
isn't always reliable. If something isn't working, try using 
a real power supply.

AVR Instruction Notes
=====================

	ldi rd,imm 

Loads an 8-bit number (0-255) into an upper half register (16-31)

	out rd,r

Copies a number from a working register to an i/0 register.

	rjmp label

Jumps to the label. The label cannot be more than 204 instructions away. This is a "relative" jump.
